<p>
    In this online-era,where everything is going web-based,we come up with the idea to develop an online portal
    which is very useful to maintain feedback reports by the admin.
    <br><br><br>
    System gives an overall result about the course for every department,which can be analysed by the administrator
    directly.This allows the University to access the feedback reports in a faster and efficient way without any loss
    of data.<br><br><br>
    It is the course evaluation process to analyze and interpret the quality of learning and teaching practice,
    and analyze the interactions between students and faculty. Online student survey software provides role-based
    security which allows authorized users to access online course evaluation forms and send
    data, while assuring confidentiality.
